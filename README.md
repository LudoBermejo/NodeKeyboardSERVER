# NodeKeyboardServer #

This is the webpage part of my NodeKeyboard app, a project that joins _Raspberry Pi_, _Makey makey_ and _Node_ in one and awesome project! 

## Getting started ##

This is a part of a full project so you will need to download the other parts in:
  
[NodeKeyboardAPP, the node app sockets and makeymakey for the win!](https://github.com/LudoBermejo/NodeKeyboardAPP)

[NodeKeyboardWEB, the webapp we use to listen to sounds and add questions](https://github.com/LudoBermejo/NodeKeyboardWEB)

Then you must change the database connection (in config.js) and maybe the port (in the same file).

#### How to work

You only need to execute the app.js; the server will create the socket server and connect with the database
